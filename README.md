## Data Analysis and ML Project
# Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and preprocessing using Python. It involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and data visualization. The dataset appears to be related to real estate prices.

# Features
Data Loading & Exploration: Uses Pandas to load and inspect the dataset. Handling Missing Values: Identifies and processes missing data. Feature Engineering: Extracts and modifies features. Data Scaling & Encoding: Uses Scikit-learn for normalization and categorical encoding. Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Technologies Used Python Pandas NumPy Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit-learn

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

# Usage
Open the Code.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to explore the dataset and preprocess it.
